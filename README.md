[Advanced Search Plus] is a module for [Omeka S] that add some fields to the
advanced search form to make search more precise.

Added fields are:

- before/on/after creation/modification date/time of any resource
- has media (for item)
- has original
- has thumbnail
- multiple media types (for item)
- multiple media types for media (included in core since Omeka S 2.0.2 for a
  single value)
- visibility public/private
- media by item set

Furthermore, it adds new search query type for properties:

- start with
- end with
- in list (via api only).
- exclude one or multiple properties (except title)

Finally, an option allows to display only the used properties and classes in the
advanced search form, with chosen-select.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

* From the zip

Download the last release [AdvancedSearchPlus.zip] from the list of releases, and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `AdvancedSearchPlus`.


Notes
-----

### Exclude properties

To exclude properties to search in, use key `except`. For example, to search
anywhere except in "bibo:content", that may contains ocr or full text, use this
api query `https://example.org/api/items?property[0][except]=bibo:content&property[0][type]=in&property[0][text]=text to search`, or in internal api:

```php
$query['property'][] = [
    'joiner' => 'and',
    'property' => '',
    'except' => $excludedFields,
    'type' => 'in',
    'text' => "text to search",
];
```

The excluded fields may be one or multiple property ids or terms.

The title cannot be excluded currently, because it is automatically added by
the core.

### Visibility

The visibility check may not working if the api url contains `&is_public=&`:
`is_public` must not be a empty string. See the patch in https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/pull/1671.
This patch is integrated in module only for url, and for call to internal api.


TODO
----

- [x] The override of a search query with "property" should be called even with "initialize = false" in the api.
